                The era of digitalization is growing at a fast pace and adopting
                digitalization to grow your business is the need of the hour.
                Nowadays, owning a website is the most common step taken by
                almost every organization, but what’s the use of the website if
                the website isn’t visible to your target audience when they are
                looking out for your products and services on the Google search.
                There’s where Search Engine Optimization (SEO) comes into the
                picture. Similarly, you own a very interesting game application,
                and it’s available on the play store, but what’s the use of
                owning a games application which doesn’t have adequate downloads
                and is not visible to the target audience. So in this condition
                also, an external force is required to boost up your application
                installs and that external force is termed ASO (App Store
                Optimisation). Let’s know these two terms SEO and ASO.
              </p>
              <h5 className="mb-2 mt-2">SEO and ASO</h5>
              <p>
                SEO and ASO have been legit marketing technologies for the last
                20 years and used to increase organic traffic for websites and
                mobile applications. SEO refers to the process of improving the
                search engine results page (SERPs) of a websites’ ranking on
                search engines like Google, Yahoo, or Bing. Developing the SEO
                strategy for your company’s website allows you to attract
                customer attention to your website and increase your profits and
                income. A well-structured SEO strategy includes both On-page and
                Off-page SEO. On-page SEO involves high search volume keywords
                and optimized content so that **search engine** spider crawls
                through millions of web pages and shows the web pages which are
                relevant to the keywords entered by the user. You need to pay
                more attention to the title tags, Meta Description, Alt tags,
                and placement of keywords while optimizing the content on the
                web page.
              </p>
              <p>
                Off-Page SEO is the combination of creating backlinks and
                cross-platform promotion to drive traffic to your website and
                increase the ranking. Backlinks can be created through a variety
                of platforms such as Quora, Social Media, and many others. SEO
                is for website ranking on the Google Search (SERP) and ASO is
                the tool to boosts up your application installs by driving the
                traffic towards your application in the play store. The main
                function of the App Store Optimization strategy is to enhance
                the visibility of the mobile application in the Android play
                store, IOS App store, Windows store, etc. The process of
                optimization helps to rank the mobile application via a specific
                keyword at the top of the search results. Before initializing
                the ASO the application was not available on the first page of
                the search result but after the execution of ASO, it is possible
                to rank at the first using the targeted keywords, hence
                increases the downloads. The main purpose of ASO is to increase
                the visibility of the mobile application and drive more
                downloads. Sound Great Right?
              </p>
              <h5 className="mb-2 mt-2">SEO vs. ASO</h5>
              <p>
                ASO and SEO have some sets of similarities and differences as
                well. Almost every marketer knows the difference and similarity
                between them. ASO is often termed as ‘SEO for Apps’, but it is
                more than that. Both are optimization tools, one is used to
                optimize the content and increase website ranking while the
                other is used to optimize mobile applications and increase their
                visibility in the play store search engine. There is a thin line
                between these two tools of optimization. The search intent on
                both platforms i.e. on website search engine and play store is
                different and hence different sets of strategies must be adopted
                to optimize the websites and apps.The search query for mobile
                applications in the play store is generally shorter than on
                Google. Specific applications are searched by their names.
                Therefore the relevant keywords must be more functional and
                short- tailed related to the specific application. Whereas, the
                search query for web in search engines tends to be longer due to
                the availability of abundance information on the web. Long Tail
                keywords work better for web search results.

                Development Agency, developing creative and interesting 2D and

                art, and design. Their mission is to provide creative, dynamic,
                and interesting games for their users to make the most of their

                design and function but they lack the coordination of ASO,
                there’s where Samp technologies come into the picture. We at
                SAMP TECHNOLOGIES have performed the ASO from the scratch for
                Mount gaming Studio. Knowing the harsh fact that only the
                development of a dynamic game is not enough, it’s ASO which is
                also equally important to make your game favourite among your
                target users. We performed the entire ASO process to increase
                the organic downloads by keeping more emphasis on relevant
                keywords.

                SEO and ASO Strategy implementation is a long, time-consuming,
                and result- oriented process. Getting ranked on the first page

                Through the development of technology, search engines often
                adjust to these modifications by changing their algorithms which
                determine how your site ranks. Stay up to date and ensure
                everything is up to date with your SEO/ASO strategy.
