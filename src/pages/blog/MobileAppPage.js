                market. And in 2021 5G connections will boom from 20 million to
                100 million according to statistics. 5G would be super fast,
                nearly 100 times faster than its predecessor 4G. Combine this
                high speed with the low latency and reliability and see why this
                technology is all strongly rooted. 5G will bring transformative
                improvements in streaming media because 4G streaming will end up
                being an illusion without buffering. The handling of 3D objects
                by VR & AR is possible with its larger bandwidth. It also leads
                to the enhanced connectivity of IOT services.
              </p>
              <h5 className="mb-2 mt-2">4. AR and VR</h5>

                The gaming and video arena have already been conquered by AR and
                VR. It is only a matter of time, however, before these
                developments reach all facets of our everyday lives. Thus, in

                also revolutionize our experience of social media. Facebook
                already had Facebook spaces introduced for interacting via VR
                with our mates. Instagram now helps us to build our own filters
                of augmented reality
              </p>
              <h5 className="mb-2 mt-2">5. Enterprise Applications</h5>

              <h5 className="mb-2 mt-2">
                6. Highly Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMPs)
              </h5>
              <p>
                Web browsing now mostly takes place via mobile devices. Rapid,
                sensitive, and user-friendly mobile app development is key to
                increasing user participation. Mobile Accelerated Pages (AMPs)
                help reduce the loading time of a page and increase its speed.
                Not only AMPs help to increase user experience, but they also
                boost user traffic. AMP has developed a strategy to boost search
                visibility, one of the fast-moving growth trends in the Mobile
                App. The loading time on AMP websites is four times faster than
                ordinary pages. Google therefore supports and traffics these
                websites. AMP contributes to improving SEO and user commitment,
                making it an unavoidable growth pattern for mobile application
                development trends in 2021.
              </p>
              <h5 className="mb-2 mt-2">7. Smart Wearable’s</h5>
              <p>
                Wearable’s make big waves among users already. Many users use
                smart watches, Smart jewels, displayed cameras, body sensors,
                etc. The cool thing is that these devices can be managed and
                communicated through different mobile applications. But by
                incorporating IOT, even from remote locations, we can monitor
                these devices over the Internet. Wearable’s can monitor and
                analyse body movements, heartbeats, steps, the temperature of
                the body, levels of blood oxygen etc. Thus, they are already
                highly profitable in the healthcare, fitness, and sports
                industries.
              </p>
              <h5 className="mb-2 mt-2">8. Biometrics Identification</h5>
              <p>
                The identification of biometric smartphones is becoming
                inevitable. Although it was used previously to open phones, it
                is now used to log in and download smartphone applications to
                bank accounts. The simplistic use of the smartphone app has an
                important impact on this trend. You dont have to type it, you
                dont have to sketch some pattern, just a touch or glance.
                However, with this pattern increasing, protection concerns still
                need to be taken into account. All the smartphone applications
                built-in 2021 should be ready to use both Touch ID and Face ID.
                Biometric verification must involve Retina detection, speech
                recognition, hand geometry, or facial characteristics, as well
                as face identification and fingerprint scanning. Its a special,
                non-replicable, constant over time and there is no danger of
                forgetting and that is what makes it a suitable security
                authentication tool.
              </p>
              <h5 className="mb-2 mt-2">9. Instant Apps</h5>
              <p>
                If we get the applications without downloading and installing
                them, we all love it, right? The ultimate solution is instant
                applications. Not only do they don’t need to be mounted, but
                they are also smaller in size as well. Thus, regardless of
                hardware or storage capacities, they are quicker than standard
                applications. As the creation of instant apps is relatively
                easier, mobile app developers and app designer can benefit
                greatly. In contrast with other apps, the cost of creating a
                smartphone app is also lower. There will be a wide emphasis on
                the growth of instant apps due to their simplistic mobile app
                design
              </p>
