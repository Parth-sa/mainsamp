                Before planning any strategy or campaign, it is of utmost
                importance to identify the target audience and understand their
                needs and behavior. The second most important thing is to
                identify your goal. What do you want? Sales conversions? Website
                visits? Or brand awareness? And the third important thing is to
                provide complete detail about your product to the website
                visitors in the form of simplistic information and an
                easy-to-access website layout. Running a campaign isnt enough,
                what matters is the achievement of your desired goals.
